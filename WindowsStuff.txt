- password spraying attack 
- you can capture the AS_REP if the user is without Kerberos pre-authentication required attribute  (ASREPRoast) ----> GetNPUsers.py
- get services with SPNs and request a TGS ticket then extract it from memory (Kerbroasting) * requires an account * ----> GetUserSPNs.py 
- passing the ntlm hash of a user to get the kerberos ticket (PTK)  ----> getTGT.py , export KRB5CCNAME=<TGT_ccache_file>, psexec.py
- stealing kerberos tickets from where its stored (PTT)
- Silver ticket * If Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) is disabled * ----> ticketer.py
- Golden ticket ----> ticketer.py --> with krbtgt account

- Kerberos Attacks
- Extracting plain text passwords from group policy preferences 
- AdminSDHolder attack * presistence *
- Ntds.dit password extraction 
- If a user has Replicating directory changes attribute enabled then he can harvest any account NTLM hash (DCSync Attack)
